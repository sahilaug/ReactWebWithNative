# ReactWebWithNative
A Barebone project for logic sharing between react-web and react-native apps.
Ideally, redux reducers should contain business logic for the app and the components should be as presentational as possible.

**Stack :**
* React
* React-Native
* Redux
* ImmutableJS
* Bulmaio - for web styling
